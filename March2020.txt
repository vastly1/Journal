03/03/2020- Blog Post 1 - Primary Election 2020 "Super Tuesday"
  Today was voting day, woke up at 3:50 am and got showered, shaved, nicked my chin twice right next to each other, it only bled for 10 minutes with pressure, great, got everything ready didn't make my lunch today, but it'll be okay I had cash in my pocket, ended up having lunch provided so that was a tiy bit of luck and nothing coming out of my pocket, hopped in the crv at ~6:35 and got to the polls at 6:50 think I was gonna get there early, that wasn't the reality of anything in this situation, as this was the first time I had ever voted I didn't exactly know the process of voting, I stood there for about 10 minutes before the doors opened and was surprised at the layout, 6 people registering you they had an ipad and a plastic tray to put your id in, handed you a receipt, and you went to another table and got a ballot. I picked a corner with a more elevated table so i can actually write comfortably, and didn't even realize how many canidates theyre actually we're and it scared me that there we're over 30 roles for just the delegation and you voted for all of it, I recognized like 3 names and actually just circled randomly afterwards, not my best desicion but have defintly made worse desicions in a faster amount of time, Need to def look into it when we get passed the primaries so I can research effectivley about everyone and pick randomly.... anyway,
